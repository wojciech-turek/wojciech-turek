### Hi there 👋

🏗️  I’m currently working on personal projects:
  - [TokenHatchery](https://tokenhatchery.com) which is a no-code contract deployed that uses well-audited OpenZepplin contracts.
  - [ActionBattleArena](https://github.com/wojciech-turek/BattleArena-Unity) is a web3 powered PvP game that utilizes NFTs for true asset ownership, built with Unity.

💡 I'm passionate about the web3 space, talk to me if you have ideas, need help with anything or just looking to chat.
